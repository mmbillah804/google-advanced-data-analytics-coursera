## 📊 Project Highlights

### 1. [Employee Turnover Prediction](./employee-turnover-analysis)

This project simulates a real-world HR use case: analyzing employee retention and building a model to predict future turnover.

- Performed hypothesis testing to investigate salary vs. job satisfaction.
- Engineered features and trained a **Random Forest classifier** to predict turnover.
- Delivered interpretability via feature importances.

### 2. [TikTok Workplace Scenario – Content Moderation Support](./tiktok-workplace-scenario)

A workplace-inspired project where I built a classifier to distinguish between **claim** and **opinion** content, assisting moderators.

- Conducted statistical testing to explore view counts between verified/unverified accounts.
- Built a robust machine learning model prioritizing **recall** to reduce moderation risks.
- Achieved near-perfect performance using text and engagement data.
