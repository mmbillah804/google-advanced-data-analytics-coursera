# TikTok Workplace Scenario: Statistical Analysis & Machine Learning Classification

This repository presents two complementary data science notebooks developed during a certification program. The project simulates a real-world workplace scenario at TikTok, where user-generated reports require automated moderation support. The goal is to analyze video data and help build a predictive model that classifies content as either a **claim** or an **opinion** to assist TikTok moderators.


## ðŸ“˜ Project 1: Hypothesis Test â€“ Verified vs. Unverified Accounts

**Objective:**  
Explore whether **verified status** of TikTok accounts influences **video view count** using statistical hypothesis testing.

**Key Steps:**
- Cleaned and explored the dataset.
- Compared mean view counts between verified and unverified users.
- Conducted a two-sample **t-test**.
- **Rejected the null hypothesis**: Verified and unverified accounts show a statistically significant difference in average video view counts.

**Insight:**  
Verified accounts consistently receive more views, implying behavioral or algorithmic differences between account types. This insight could inform further user-behavior modeling.

## ðŸ¤– Project 2: Machine Learning Model â€“ Claim vs. Opinion Classification

**Objective:**  
Build a machine learning model to classify TikTok video content as **claim** or **opinion**, helping prioritize moderation efforts.

**Workflow Highlights:**
- Target variable: `claim_status` (binary classification)
- Preprocessing: Handled missing values, performed feature engineering (e.g., text length, n-grams)
- Model: Trained a **Random Forest** classifier with hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV`
- Metric of interest: **Recall** (to reduce false negatives)
- Achieved high accuracy and excellent recall, minimizing the risk of missing harmful claim content.

**Key Insight:**  
Engagement metrics (views, likes, shares) and text characteristics are strong indicators of whether a video is likely to be a claim.
